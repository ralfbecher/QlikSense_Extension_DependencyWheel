Qlik Sense Extensions Dependency Wheel
======================================

***

### Caution:

This open source Qlik Sense extension is discontinued since it became a commercial product of TIQ Solutions.

You can find a **supported version** with more features on the <a href="https://www.vizlib.com/marketplace/tiqchorddiagram">**Vizlib Marketplace**</a>.

***

This extension visualizes dependencies between two dimensions using an interactive disc. Internally, a graph data model is used. Each disc section represents a source and/or target node, and links between arcs are edges and materialize dependencies between nodes. All aggregation and rendering is done client-side in JavaScript. Built with <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3">d3.js</a> and Francois Zaninotto's <a href="http://fzaninotto.github.com/DependencyWheel">d3.dependencyWheels.js</a>, published with the MIT open-source license.
